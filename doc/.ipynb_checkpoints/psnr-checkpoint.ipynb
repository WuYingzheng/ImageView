    "Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) is the ratio between the maximum possible power of an image and the power of corrupting noise that affects the quality of its representation. To estimate the PSNR of an image, it is necessary to compare that image to an ideal clean image with the maximum possible power.\n",
